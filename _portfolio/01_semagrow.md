The SemaGrow project (November 2012 - October 2015) developed methods
and infrastructure laying the foundations for the scalable, efficient,
and decentralized Web of Data. The SemaGrow project used the
large-scale and complex agricultural data service ecosystem as a
testbed for its federated query processing technologies.

Visit [http://www.semagrow.eu](http://www.semagrow.eu) for public
deliverables and other details.

Project outcomes are demontrated by the
[Semagrow](http://semagrow.github.io)
federated query processing system. Semagrow is maintained beyond the
SemaGrow action's end and has been used by DEG as a vehicle for
several subsequent related research activities.
