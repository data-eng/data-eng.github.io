# Semagrow 2 has been released

Semagrow 2 is the first major release since the end of the SemaGrow
project that initiated Semagrow development.

The namespace of all classpaths has been changed from eu.semagrow. to
org.semagrow. The Sesame infrastructure has been updated to the
rdf4j-2.x framework. Semagrow has been dockerized. The query optimizer
can now handle nested SPARQL queries. And, of course, several
bugfixes.

Clone it from
```
https://github.com/semagrow/semagrow
```
or directly download v2 from
```
https://github.com/semagrow/semagrow/archive/2.0.0.tar.gz
```

We are looking forward to getting your bug reports, feature requests,
pull requests.
